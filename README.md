# todojitsu

Todojitsu a todo web app based on the MEAN stack, Mongodb, Express, Angular and Node. It was created as a learning excercise, and should be considered a toy app. The unique feature of todojitsu is that instead of requiring a user to sign in, a new page can be created simply by going to an address:

todojitsu.com/*yourname*

You can assign a password to each unique page you create. Each page allows multiple sub-lits, drag and drop sorting, and undo/redo capability.
